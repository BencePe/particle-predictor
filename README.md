Air Quality Big Data Collection & Prediction System is a modular, Python-based project designed to monitor, store, and forecast air quality metrics in real time. The system collects high-frequency sensor data alongside external data sources and leverages machine learning techniques to predict future air quality trends.

Real-Time Monitoring: Collect minute-by-minute data from local sensors.
Data Fusion: Integrate online API data (weather, traffic) with sensor readings.
Big Data Storage: Utilize time-series databases for scalable data storage.
Machine Learning Forecasting: Train and update predictive models based on historical data.
